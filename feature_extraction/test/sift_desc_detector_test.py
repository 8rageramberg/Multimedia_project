#In the context of feature detection algorithms like SIFT, SURF, or FAST, the term
#"response strength" refers to a measure of how distinctive or prominent a particular feature
#or keypoint is in an image.

# Access response value of the first keypoint
# first_keypoint_response = keypoints[0].response

########################################################################

# So my idea is this:

#Calculate 40 keypoints for each and every photo in a database.
# These keypoints should be the 40 keypoints with the most "response strength".
# Afterwards I want to reduce the dimensionality of it from 128 to lets say 20 or 30 
# (depending on if the cumulative variance explained by 30 is atleast 80%). 
# Then I want to send a picture as a prompt. this follows the same manners as before and is
# reduced to a 40x30 array. Then I want to calculate the distance between all of its vectors
# to other pictures with a specified threshold. 

# The picture with the most matching vectors (or descriptors) gets chosen 
# and returned to the user.

#Is this a good approach? Why / why not?
